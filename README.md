# Notes-Android

  -In this assignment I have used OkHTTP library to implement a simple note taker application, which uses an API hosted remotely. 
  -I have used API to sign up, login, save new notes, get notes, delete the notes, and so on. 
  -Shared Preferences is used to save the web token locally, and manage the session.
  -Users will be able to Signin, login, logout, add noted and delete notes.
